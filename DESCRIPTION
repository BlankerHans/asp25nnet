Description: Provides tools for training and evaluating neural networks tailored 
    to the estimation of the mean and the standard deviation of a target variable. 
    Includes a neural network with hidden layers adjustable in size and number, 
    a neural additive model based on Thielmann et al. (2024), as well as functions
    for data preparation and model evaluation.
