Description: Provides tools for training and evaluating neural networks tailored 
to the estimation of the mean and the standard deviation of a target variable. Includes a neural network with hidden layers 
adjustable in size and number, a neural additive model based on Thielmann et al. (2024)
as well as functions for data preperation and model evaluation.
