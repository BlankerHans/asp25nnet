summary_namls(
  object,
  data,
  target_col,

}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Trained NAMLS model object containing parameters, optimizer, learning rate,
epochs, losses, and training information.}

\item{data}{Data frame used for model evaluation, including predictors and target.}

\item{target_col}{Character string with the name of the target variable.}

\item{dummy_cols}{Optional character vector of column names that were one-hot encoded.}

\item{pm1_scaler}{List containing feature scaling parameters from pm1_scaler() function,
with elements 'a' (min values), 'b' (max values), and 'eps'. If NULL, no feature
scaling is applied.}

\item{target_mean}{Numeric; mean of target variable from training set used for
normalization. If NULL, no target denormalization is performed.}

\item{target_sd}{Numeric; standard deviation of target variable from training set
used for normalization. If NULL, no target denormalization is performed.}

\item{show_plot}{Logical; if TRUE, plots of losses and predictions are shown. Default is TRUE.}

\item{yscale}{Character; determines y-axis scaling for loss plots:
\code{"auto"} (linear), \code{"log"} (logarithmic), \code{"robust"} (capped at quantile).}

\item{cap_quantile}{Numeric (0-1); quantile for robust loss capping. Default is 0.99.}

\item{drop_first}{Integer; number of initial epochs to exclude from loss plots. Default is 0.}

\item{feature_plots}{Logical; if TRUE and more than one feature is present, partial effect
plots are generated. Default is TRUE.}

\item{max_features}{Integer; maximum number of features to display in partial effect plots.
Default is 6.}

\item{ci_z}{Numeric; z-value used for confidence interval calculation.
Default is 1.96 (approximately 95\% CI).}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the input \code{object} after printing a summary and
optionally plotting results.
}
\description{
Provides a summary of a trained NAMLS model, including its architecture,
training setup, training results, and visualizations of model predictions.
Depending on the number of input features, it produces loss curves,
1D fits with confidence intervals, or partial effect plots for multiple features.
