\title{Random Split of a Dataset}
\usage{
random_split(data, split = c(0.8, 0.2), normalization = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A numeric matrix or data frame to split.}

\item{split}{Numeric vector of length 2 specifying the proportions for the train and test sets. Default is \code{c(0.8, 0.2)}.}

\item{normalization}{Logical value indicating whether to normalize the data. Default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements:
\item{train}{The training set as a matrix.}
\item{test}{The test set as a matrix.}
}
\description{
Splits a dataset into training and test sets based on the specified proportions.
Optionally applies normalization (mean centering and scaling) to all columns.
}
\details{
If the sum of \code{split} is less than 1, the remaining proportion of rows will be excluded from both splits.
Normalization applies scaling across all rows before splitting.
Rows are selected sequentially without shuffling.
}
\examples{
data <- matrix(rnorm(100), ncol = 5)
result <- random_split(data, split = c(0.7, 0.3), normalization = TRUE)
dim(result$train)
dim(result$test)
