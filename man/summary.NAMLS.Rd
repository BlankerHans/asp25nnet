\usage{
\method{summary}{NAMLS}(
  object,
  data,
  target_col,
  show_plot = TRUE,
  yscale = c("auto", "log", "robust"),
  cap_quantile = 0.99,
  drop_first = 0,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Trained NAMLS model object containing parameters, optimizer, learning rate,
epochs, losses, and optional normalization info.}

\item{data}{Data frame used for model evaluation, including predictors and target.}

\item{target_col}{Character string with the name of the target variable.}

\item{show_plot}{Logical; if TRUE, plots of losses and predictions are shown. Default is TRUE.}

\item{yscale}{Character; determines y-axis scaling for loss plots:
\code{"auto"} (linear), \code{"log"} (logarithmic), \code{"robust"} (capped at quantile).}

\item{cap_quantile}{Numeric (0–1); quantile for robust loss capping. Default is 0.99.}

\item{drop_first}{Integer; number of initial epochs to exclude from loss plots. Default is 0.}

\item{feature_plots}{Logical; if TRUE and more than one feature is present, partial effect
plots are generated. Default is TRUE.}

\item{max_features}{Integer; maximum number of features to display in partial effect plots. Default is 6.}

\item{ci_z}{Numeric; z-value used for confidence interval calculation. Default is 1.96 (≈ 95\% CI).}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the input \code{object} after printing a summary and
optionally plotting results.
}
\description{
Provides a summary of a trained NAMLS model, including its architecture,
training setup, training results, and visualizations of model predictions.
Depending on the number of input features, it produces loss curves,
1D fits with confidence intervals, or partial effect plots for multiple features.
