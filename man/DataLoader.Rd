\title{DataLoader: Load data in batches with optional shuffling}
\usage{
DataLoader(data, batch_size = 32, shuffle = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A matrix to be processed in batches. (Use the output of the train_val_tes func)}

\item{batch_size}{Integer specifying the size of each batch (default is 32).}

\item{shuffle}{Logical, whether to shuffle the data before batching (default is FALSE).}
}
\value{
A list of lists, each containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{batch}: A matrix (features Ã— batch size) with the batch data.
\item \code{idx}: An integer vector with the original indices of data points in the batch.
}
}
\description{
Splits a dataset into batches of size \code{batch_size}.
Optionally shuffles the data before batching.
Each batch is transposed and returned along with the indices of included data points.
}
\details{
The function generates start indices for the batches (e.g., 1, 33, 65, ... with \code{batch_size = 32}) and extracts the corresponding rows from \code{data}.
Each batch is transposed (columns represent individual data points) and returned along with their indices.
}
\examples{
df <- data.frame(x = rnorm(100), y = rnorm(100))
res <- train_val_test(df, split = c(0.6, 0.2, 0.2))
train_loader <- DataLoader(res$train, batch_size = 50, shuffle = FALSE)
str(batches[[1]])

}
